# Leetcode Documentation
The purpose of this is to document my leetcode journey and provide my own descriptions

Algorithms will mostly be done in Python (im lazy when it comes to coding syntax :( )

# START DATE: 3/28/3034

## Goals:
- I will be trying to get one leetcode done every other day (if possible one per day) depending on how fast my brain works
  - Documentation may potentially be little behind but will try to get done the day of
- Provide valid explinations of my line of thinking
- Expand into SQL codeing practice
- get a job lol

## System:
- Each problem will be put into its respective folder depending on what algorithm is used
  - Inspiried by the [NeetCode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap)
- SQL problems will be documented in its own folder
